## Current Features:

### "Limit Weapons to Builder Loadout"
When enabled, anyone who enters Buildmode will be stripped of their weapons and gived the "builder loadout", set by an admin.

### "Respawn Players on Buildmode Exit"
When enabled, anyone who exits Buildmode will be returned to spawn as to prevent the sneaky types from entering someones base while in Buildmode then turning it off to kill anyone there

### "Players Spawn with Buildmode"
When enabled, Buildmode will be enabled by default

### "Allow Noclip in Buildmode"
When enabled, players in Buildmode will be able to Noclip

"sv_noclip" must be set to 0, otherwise all players will have the ability to noclip

this setting does not interfere with ULX Noclip

### "Prevent Propkill In Buildmode"
When enabled, players in Buildmode will have a slightly more difficult time trying to propkill

I suggest not using this and instead getting a dedicated anti-propkill plugin as this is not the main feature of this addon

### Highlight Builders
When enabled, players in Buildmode will have an outline using a color chosen by and admin

### Highlight PVPers
When enabled, players NOT in Buildmode will have an outline using a color chosen by and admin
