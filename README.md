# Buildmode-ULX
Hopefully prevent Builders from abusing GodMode

Hopefully prevents PVPers from bothering Builders

## Current Features:

#### "Limit Weapons to Builder Loadout"
When enabled, anyone who enters Buildmode will be stripped of their weapons and gived the "builder loadout", set by an admin.

#### "Respawn Players on Buildmode Exit"
When enabled, anyone who exits Buildmode will be returned to spawn as to prevent the sneaky types from entering someones base while in Buildmode then turning it off to kill anyone there

#### "Players Spawn with Buildmode"
When enabled, Buildmode will be enabled by default

#### "Allow Noclip in Buildmode"
When enabled, players in Buildmode will be able to Noclip

"sv_noclip" must be set to 0, otherwise all players will have the ability to noclip

this setting does not interfere with ULX Noclip

#### "Prevent Propkill In Buildmode"
When enabled, players in Buildmode will have a slightly more difficult time trying to propkill

Builders can not throw props

Props and Vehicles are noclipped when Builders pick them up with a physgun

Props and Vehicles are noclipped when Builders spawn them

Props and Vehicles that are noclipped do not collide with players, however they will collide with other props

Vehicles are noclipped when a Builder enters them or when the driver enables Buildmode

Props and Vehicles are unnoclipped when the prop is not moving (so they can not fall on players and kill them) and when no players are inside the prop (so Builders shouldn't be able to prop-trap players)

#### "Highlight Builders"
When enabled, players in Buildmode will have an outline using a color chosen by and admin

#### "Highlight PVPers"
When enabled, players NOT in Buildmode will have an outline using a color chosen by and admin
